# AMI-Model-2019


The Weather Interpolate file needs to be run first, it creates three CSVs that are too big to load into Github. 

The function creates "dayTimestamps.csv" and "fullWeather.csv" 

Next, run the AMI model code, the first time it is run you must create the new comparable timestamp .JSON file, as it is also too large to load into Github.

In your project folder, subfolders for images outputted (filepath/project_folder/Figures) and a subfolder for result CSVs (filepath/project_folder/output) should be created.
